# Section 1.1: Assembly and Computer Basics

Before we can understand assembly, we must first understand some computer basics. 

### Computer Basics:

#### Binary:
* Binary simply means "composed of, or involving two things." In our case, with computers, we are speaking of a data size called *bits*. Binary in relation to computers, in the most basic sense, represents "on/1", "off/0". When combining multiple bits, we can come up with larger data units that can represent more complex data such as numbers or text. 

#### Data Sizes

* **Bits:** Bits are the smallest unit of data a computer can offer. These are represented as a single binary value: 0 or 1. 8 bits equal a *byte*
* **Bytes:** 
    * Bytes are a unit of information storage. 
    * They are a series of 8 bits. Though it's not as easy as just combining 8 bits together. 
    * Each bit represents a different number. When a bit in a byte is turned on, the overall numeric representation of the byte changes. 
    * Bytes are read from far right bit (least significant bit or LSB) to far left bit (most significant bit or MSB). 
    * Each bit (and all data on computers) are meassured in powers of 2
    * These are the values of each bit: 128 | 64 | 32 | 16 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1  - with 128 being the MSB and 1 being the LSB.
    * If all bits are turned on, the largest number we get is 256, giving us 256 unique "patterns" we can create. 
    * Bytes can be combined into larger information storage types:
        * **Kilobytes** 2^10 = 1024 bytes
        * **Megabytes** 2^20 = 1,048,576 bytes
        * **Gigabytes** 2^30 = 1,073,741,824 bytes
        * **Terabytes** 2^40 = a huge number...
        * and so on...
        * Ever notice that a hard drive is smaller than advertised? Well, that's because the folks who create hard drives use 1000 kilobytes in a megabyte. It comes out to quite a difference in larger hard drives. 
* We also have a few other data units such as Nibble (4 bits), Word (16 bits) and some others we will be going over later.

#### Hardware Components

##### CPU (Central Processing Unit):

* The CPU is the electronic circuitry within a computer that carries out the instructions of a program by performing basic arithmetic, logical, control and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions. In otherwords, the CPU is what's doing all of the "thinking". This is the primary piece of hardware assembly acts on. Things that happen here are happening the fastest. This is also the centeral point in which we define speed... hardware farthest from this are slower. 

##### RAM (Random-Access Memory)

* RAM is a form of computer data storage that stores data and machine code currently being used. This is the secondary piece of hardware assembly acts on. 

##### HDD/SDD (Hard Disk Drive/ Solid Disk Drive)

* Disk drives are a data storage device which are non-volatile (meaning they retain stored data even when powered off). Disk drives are one of the farthest components from the CPU. They are much slower than CPU instructions or access to RAM... but they can hold much more data, even when not being used. There are two types of Disk Drives currently, Hard Disk Drives and Solid Disk Drives. HDDs rely on rotating disks and other additional moving mechanics to store data. Whereas an SDD does not have many moving parts, if any. Due to this, SSDs are faster and less prone to shock damage. Regardless, additional information about either type of disk drive isn't really helpful for this course.

### Understanding Assembly

#### What is assembly? 
Assembly provides "instructions" (aka human-friendly) that map to "opcodes" (aka processor-friendly). Assembly is typically very hardware-specific. 

#### Why use assembly?
There are a number of reasons to use assembly. The most common reason is performance. Rather than letting the compiler come up with possibly long and drawn out assembly on compilation, create the asm yourself for better optimization (where it applies). Assembly also exploses hardware features that may not have been avalaible. Lastly, another reason to use assembly is that some operations are easier to express than in higher level languages such as C. 

#### Assembly Instructions and Opcodes
##### Operands
Assembly code typically consist of an instruction of some kind and some operands. Operands can consist of several things, such as *Registers*, *Memory Addresses*, and *Immediate (literal) Values*. There are also other data types and some prefixes (which modify what the instruction does). We will dive deeply into a ton of all of the above. 

##### Opcodes
Opcodes are one or more bytes that the processor decodes (and executes)

# Assembly Data Types and GDB Part 2

* When we think "data types", we need to understand that in Assembly, it's a different concept than in higher level languages. Typically, data types are just bytes in a buffer. Data type is just an interpretation that's differentiated by size, alignment and certain bits being set. 
* Some operations preserve special properties in a given data set (such as sign, e.g. (+/-))
* Other operations may expect different alignments in data, or may have issues with certain values (like floating points)

### X86(_64) General Data Sizes
* Byte - smallest addressable unit (8 bit)
* Word - 2 bytes
* Dword - double word (4 bytes - x86 pointer width)
* Qword - quad word (8 bytes - x64 pointer width)

## GDB: Examining Memory

* We can use GDB to examine varius places in memory "x" (for "eXamine")
* x has several options: 
    * x/nfu - where n is the *Number* of things to examine, f is the *Format* and u is the *Unit* size
    * x addr - examines the memory address typed in by the user
    * x $<register> - examines the memory address pointed to by the register

# Section 1.3: Debugging Assembly & Making the Files

![](/imgs/gdb4.png)

## Why Debug Assembly?

Unlike many other programming languages, assembly allows for much more control over lower level software/hardware. We will be making changes that are much harder to track mentally. Debugging allows us to see the memory itself, registers, etc. Some debugging tools even allow us to modify said registers and memory values. 

We will be using the GNU Project Debugger or **GDB** for short. GDB is a command line debugger which provides a large set of features:
* Natively supports Python scripting
* Supports a large number of architectures (and even quite a few languages)
* Provides a Text User Interface (TUI) mode

## How to Debug using Assembly

### Preconfiguration
When launching GDB, you may notice your interface does not look like mine. This is because I use a configuration file that adds customization to my interface. Lucky for you, we provided you with a preconfiguration file. The **gdbinit** providese a way to run a number of setup commands at launch. You will just need to copy the config file to your home directory:
```
cp ~/path/to/repo/handouts/sample![](/imgs/gdb1.png)![](/imgs/gdb1.png)-gdbinit ~/.gdbinit
```
*The instructions above will copy the sample gdbinit to your home directory as a hidden file (as directed by the . in front of the name) and will rename it to gdbinit*

### Make the Files
After you have written your code, you will need to cd to the path and run a series of commands to make the files. 

Change Dirs to proper lab:
```
cd ~/path/to/lab1/
```

Make the files (DO NOT FORGET THE PERIODS!):
```
cmake . && cmake --build .
```
*There is a file in the lab directory called CMakeLists.txt. This file instructs/configures a program build tool called **CMAKE** to build the nasm and cpp file and output an executable. If you peek inside of the cpp file, you will notice a couple of things. First, we "extern" some functions. This allows us to create a link of sort between the nasm and cpp file. We then later call the extern'd function in main (or some other function) as if it were a regular function. If you don't understand how the C/C++ compiler and linker work, feel free to ask for a refresher and I will provide one given we have time.*

### Launching an Executable with GDB
1. CD to directory containing lab
2. run: gdb labx (x being the lab number)
3. In the GDB window, type "run" to execute the program. The program will run all the way through because there are no break points. 
4. In the GDB window, type "quit" to quit GDB. You will be returned to the standard terminal. 
```
$ cd ~/path/to/lab1
$ gdb lab1

(gdb) run
...
(gdb) quit
```

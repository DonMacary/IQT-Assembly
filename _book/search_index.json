Binary in relation to computers, in the most basic sense, represents \"on/1\", \"off/0\". When combining multiple bits, we can come up with larger data units that can represent more complex data such as numbers or text. \n\nData Sizes\n\n\nBits: Bits are the smallest unit of data a computer can offer. These are represented as a single binary value: 0 or 1. 8 bits equal a byte\nBytes: \nBytes are a unit of information storage. \nThey are a series of 8 bits. Though it's not as easy as just combining 8 bits together. \nEach bit represents a different number. When a bit in a byte is turned on, the overall numeric representation of the byte changes. \nBytes are read from far right bit (least significant bit or LSB) to far left bit (most significant bit or MSB). \nEach bit (and all data on computers) are meassured in powers of 2\nThese are the values of each bit: 128 | 64 | 32 | 16 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1  - with 128 being the MSB and 1 being the LSB.\nIf all bits are turned on, the largest number we get is 256, giving us 256 unique \"patterns\" we can create. \nBytes can be combined into larger information storage types:\nKilobytes 2^10 = 1024 bytes\nMegabytes 2^20 = 1,048,576 bytes\nGigabytes 2^30 = 1,073,741,824 bytes\nTerabytes 2^40 = a huge number...\nand so on...\nEver notice that a hard drive is smaller than advertised? Well, that's because the folks who create hard drives use 1000 kilobytes in a megabyte. It comes out to quite a difference in larger hard drives. \n\n\n\n\nWe also have a few other data units such as Nibble (4 bits), Word (16 bits) and some others we will be going over later.\n\nHardware Components\nCPU (Central Processing Unit):\n\n\nThe CPU is the electronic circuitry within a computer that carries out the instructions of a program by performing basic arithmetic, logical, control and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions. In otherwords, the CPU is what's doing all of the \"thinking\". This is the primary piece of hardware assembly acts on. Things that happen here are happening the fastest. This is also the centeral point in which we define speed... hardware farthest from this are slower. When we say registers, this is where we are talking about. \n\nRAM (Random-Access Memory)\n\n\nRAM is a form of computer data storage that stores data and machine code currently being used. This is the secondary piece of hardware assembly acts on. When we say we are accessing memory addresses, this is the location in the computer we are talking about.  \n\nHDD/SDD (Hard Disk Drive/ Solid Disk Drive)\n\n\nDisk drives are a data storage device which are non-volatile (meaning they retain stored data even when powered off). Disk drives are one of the farthest components from the CPU. They are much slower than CPU instructions or access to RAM... but they can hold much more data, even when not being used. There are two types of Disk Drives currently, Hard Disk Drives and Solid Disk Drives. HDDs rely on rotating disks and other additional moving mechanics to store data. Whereas an SDD does not have many moving parts, if any. Due to this, SSDs are faster and less prone to shock damage. Regardless, additional information about either type of disk drive isn't really helpful for this course. When we say file I/O... this is where we are talking about.\n\nCPU Architecture\nWe won't get too far into this, but there are different CPU architectures that offer different register sizes and such. Some basic ones to keep in mind for now are: \n\nIntel x86(_64)\nIntel x86\nAMD x86\nAMD x86(_64)\nARM\nPowerPC\n\nAdditional Information\n\nx86 refers to Intel's processor architecture that was used in PCs. It was a backwards compatable to 16-bit systems and currently supports up to 64 bit standard register sizes via the x64 extension. This is not including SIMD registers (which can be upwards of 512-bit). Don't worry too much about what registers are just yet. \nx86(_64) is an extension for x86 that brought raised the register size from 32bit to 64bit. This was done to combat 32bit x86's processor limitations in memory addressing in an age where everyone else was on 64bit systems only. (Refer to history lesson below), x86(_64) provides backwards compatability while utilizing the performance advantage of 64 bit architectures. \n\nA History of Copying\n\nAs said above, x86 refers to Intel's processor architectures that was used in PCs (80186, 80386, 80486). Back in 1982, AMD actually was contracted by Intel to be a second-source manufacturer of the 8086 and 8088 Intel processors. AMD went on to develop it's own chip, the Am286. In 1984, Intel decided to no longer cooperate with AMD and refused to convey technical details of the Intel 80386 to AMD. In 1987, AMD invoked arbitration over the issue causing Intel to cancel their 1982 technological-exchange agreement altogether. AMD eventually won arbitration in 1992 cuasing Intel to dispute which led to a Supreme Court case in California who sided with AMD. \n\nIn 1990, Intel countersued AMD, forcing AMD to clean-room design versions of intel code for it's x386 and x486 processors... long after intel had released its own x386 in 1985. In March 1991, AMD released the Am386 which was a clone of the Intel 386 processor. This eventually led to an agreement between Intel and AMD where AMD received the rights to the microcode in Intel's x386 and x486 processor families, but not the rights to any processors that followed. \n\nFast forward, AMD eventually caught up to Intel, by the 2000's it became clear that 32-bit x86 processors were just not going to cut it in a time where 64 bit processors were coming out. So Intel attempted to create a backwards compatible 64bit/32bit processor, which failed. Then Intel decided to drop 32-bit all together, which failed. Finally, AMD decided to take another path of backwards compatibility that did not suffer the same high costs and performance issues as Intel's first attempt. In 2003, AMD released the first x86 processor with 64-bit general-purpose registers, the Opteron. This brought in additional capabilities such as accessing much more than 4GB of virtual memory using the new x86(_64) extension (also known as AMD64).\n\nIn July 2004, Intel responded with it's own x86(_64) processor, the Prescott Pentium 4. Which currently brings us to our CPU battles today. \n\n\nThe Future\n\nBy 2020, Apple will be creating it's own CPUs. Apple has had a history of using PowerPC chips and now Intel chips. But it feels the CPU market is moving entirely too slow. \n\nMost likely by 2019, Apple will entirely drop 32 bit support on it's operating systems. Apple is currently issuing out warning prompts saying \"App\" is not optmized for your Mac. With an even more urgent warning prompt on it's beta OS's. \n\n\nHow does this apply to us?\n\nAs we will get into here soon, different CPU Architectures will have different individual quarks and features that make them stand out. There are also different syntaxes that we will observe as well. But most importantly, we need to understand the different sizes of general purpose registers in correlation to the CPU Architecture. 64 bit CPUs for instance, will have more and larger general purpose registers whereas a 32 or 16 bit OS will only have registers up to that size. This will dictate which instructions we use and how we access different types of data. \n\n\n"},"01_Introduction/01.2_Asm_Basics.html":{"url":"01_Introduction/01.2_Asm_Basics.html","title":"ASM Basics","keywords":"","body":"Section 1.2: Assembly Basics & Memory\nNow that we understand some basic computer concepts, we can hop into Assembly with a bit more understanding of some of it's underlying concepts. \nUnderstanding Assembly\nWhat is assembly?\nAssembly provides \"instructions\" (aka human-friendly) that map to \"opcodes\" (aka processor-friendly). Assembly is typically very hardware-specific. \nWhy use assembly?\nThere are a number of reasons to use assembly. The most common reason is performance. Rather than letting the compiler come up with possibly long and drawn out assembly on compilation, create the asm yourself for better optimization (where it applies). Assembly also exploses hardware features that may not have been avalaible. Lastly, another reason to use assembly is that some operations are easier to express than in higher level languages such as C. \nAssembly Instructions and Opcodes\nOperands\nAssembly code typically consist of an instruction of some kind and some operands. Operands can consist of several things, such as Registers, Memory Addresses, and Immediate (literal) Values. There are also other data types and some prefixes (which modify what the instruction does). We will dive deeply into a ton of all of the above. \nOpcodes\nOpcodes are one or more bytes that the processor decodes (and executes). Typically opcodes translate directly from assembly language instructions, thus the syntax is slightly complicated. Opcodes can be different sizes depending on the system architype. \nInstructions\n\nThis set of instructions:mov eax, 0x01\nret\n\n\nBecomes:0xb8 0x01 0x00 0x00 0x00\n0xc3\n\n\n\n\nAssemblers and Syntax\nThere are a number of different assemblers to choose from. With different assemblers comes different syntaxes. There are some other slight differences and quirks depending on the Assembler you choose. Here are some of the different assemblers to choose from:\n\nGAS: The GNU Assembler\nNASM/YASM: The Netwide Assembler/Yet Another Assembler (a rewrite of NASM)\nMASM: The Microsoft Assembler\n\nWe will be using NASM on this course which uses Intel Syntax\nSyntax Differences\n\nIntel Syntax (Used by NASM/YASM and others):mov eax, 0x01\n\n\nAT&T Syntax (Used by GAS and others)movl $0x01, %eax\n\nOther syntaxes do exist\n\n\nByte Ordering\nByte ordering determines the order in which bytes appear in memory. As Americans (and even humans in most cases), we are conditioned to read things left to right. Computers are not the same though. They can read data in any which way. In our case, we are only concerned with how a computer determines the order to read bytes in memory. \n\nBig Endian stores the most significant bytes (or largest) value first. \n\nSo for instance, the memory address: 0x10203040 would appear as... 0x10 0x20 0x30 0x40\n\n\nLittle Endian on the other hand stores the least significant bytes (or smallest) firsst. \n\nFor instance, the memory address: 0x10203040 would appear as... 0x40, 0x30, 0x20, 0x10\nLittle Endian is what x86(_64) uses. \nAgain, least significant byte (not bit) is what appears first. \nIn memory, this address:  0xdeadbeef\n\nBecomes:  0xefbeadde\nBreakdown\n| Initial: | 0xde | 0xad | 0xbe | 0xef |\n| Memory: | 0xef | 0xbe | 0xad | 0xde | \n\n\n\nMemory\nWhen talking about memory, we need to understand first that there are multiple different types of memory components. These memory components vary in access speed. Most higher level languages (Such as C or Python) abstract this concept away so that the developer is not very exposed to it. Assembly on the other hand gives you more control (some things are still hidden on modern systems)\nMemory: Fastest to Slowest\n\nRegisters\nCache (L1/L2/L3)\nSystem Memory (RAM) \nDisk (HDD/SDD/etc) \n\nVirtual Memory\nVirtual Memory is a feature of modern operating systems that add a bit of abstraction from the hardware. Most addressing deals with virtual addresses, that is to say, if we want to access an address we do so by utilizing virtual addresses. These addresses are translated (via the lookup table) to physical addresses. \n**Additional Features of Virtual Memory:**\n* More than one \"view\" of of a physical memory address can exist (in different processes). That means we can access the same physical memory address through the use of multiple virtual addresses. \n* Each user mode process appears to have a full range of addressable memory and resources\n* Most modern OS's support paging. \nMemory: Process Memory Layout\nBelow is a very high level view of the Process Memory Layout:\n\n\nStack segments typically grow from high memory addresses to low.\nI know many of us may have forgotten what the stack was, but no need to worry. We will go very deep and technical on the stack in the next section. \n\n\nModules in the diagram above indicate executable files loaded into the file space. This includes:\nGlibc (specifically the .so containing the libc code)\nkernel32.dll\nCurrently running executable\n\n\nThere are also the HEAP sections and anonymous mappings\nKernel Memory\nOther Items\n\n\nRegisters\nAssembly programming gives us total control over access to registers. We are also given access to special hardware instructions on the processor. Some registers are general purpose (can store any type of data) while others are more specialized. These specialized registers can contain: status codes, flags, or be associated to specific hardware. Registers are limited in number and that number depends on a number of factors to include chip and architecture. \nGeneral Purpose Registers\nGeneral Purpose Registers give us access to subregisters. Depending on the processor, registers will have a set maximum size, different naming conventions, etc. The larger the size, the more subregisters we have. Let's break it down a bit further: \n\nThere are four main type of register sizes: 64bit/32bit/16bit/8bit.\nIf you have a 64bit system, you have access to 64bit registers and their subregisters\nThe subregisters of a 64bit system are simply: 32bit/16bit/8bit. \n\n\nThe same is for any size\n\n\nSub registers are NOT their own register. They simply act as a way of only modifying a certain number of bits of the total size register, depending on the processor. So if we have a 64bit CPU and access the 18bit subregister of one of the 64bit registers, only the lower 18bits get accessed/modified. There are of course exceptions to higher/lower, etc. Which we will cover later. \nKeep that in mind when modfying a subregister. You will modify that many bits in the actual register too. \n\n\nx86(_64) contains many more registers than just x86. But not all of those registers have subregisters. \n\nx86(_64) Registers\n\n\n\n\n64bit\n32bit\n16bit\n8bit high/low\n\n\n\n\n\nrax\neax\nax\nah/al\n\n\n\n\nrcx\necx\ncx\nch/cl\n\n\n\n\nrdx\nedx\ndx\ndh/dl\n\n\n\n\nrdi\nedi\nN/A\nN/A\n\n\n\n\nrsi\nesi\nN/A\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are other registers:\nrbp/ebp: Base Pointer \nrsp/esp: Stack Pointer (More to come on both of these)\nrip/eip: Instruction Pointer (or Program Counter) \nAdditional x86(_64) registers: r8-r15\n\n\n\nRegister Data and Pointers\n\nGeneral Purpose Registers can contain up to pointer-sized amounts of data (4 bytes on 32bit, 8 on 64bit)\nThey can also contain memory addresses (pointers) to blocks of data residing elsewhere in the process. \nAddresses can be manipulated via addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc\nSquare brackets dereference (Access the data stored at the memory address) \n\nExample:\n; a register we will be acting on whatever is directly stored in it (address or data)\nrax\n\n; a register that we assume has an address to some data\n; We are attempting to access that data and manipulate it\n[rax]\n\n\nLet's do another example:\nmov rax, 0xc0ffee   ; a memory address, hopefully valid! (What happens if it's not?)\nmov [rax], 100      ; now we store some data in that address\n\n; now let's copy that address to another register\nmov rcx, rax        ; Both rax and rcx point to the same location, right?\n\n\n\nNow let's copy the data stored at the address, and put it into RCX\nmov rcx, [rcx]\n\n\n\nHow does this work? \n\nRCX is currently holding an address. To be even more specific, RCX's data is a numeric value... \nWe tell the assembler that RCX's data, though numeric, represents a address and that we want to access it. That's where the dereference blocks come in []. \nThe assembler then says: Okay, this is an address. Let me access it. \nAfter the assembler accesses it... we grab the data that's at that address and pull it out and store it back into RCX... replacing the address. \nIn summary:\n[UNCHANGED] the address itself (It's no longer being pointed to by RCX though)\n[UNCHANGED] the data that's at the address (We stored 100 in there, but never acted on it since)\n[CHANGED] the value stored in RCX (to whatever data was in the address)\n\n\n\n\nWhat happens if you try to mov a dereferenced address value into a dereferenced address value?\n\n\n\n\nInstructions\nNOP\n\nDoes nothing (Kinda sorta)\nUsed for padding/alignment and timing reasons\nIdempotent instruction (does not affect anything else in the system)\n1 byte NOP instruction translates to opcode 0x90 (more to come on this)\n\nMemory Access\nWe'll begin looking at instructions to copy and access data from various locations in memory. Additionally, we will begin examining address calculation\nmov instruction\n\nThe mov instruction moves a small block of memory from a source (right hand operand) to the destination (left hand operand)\nAmount of data can be specified (will go over later)\nBasic usage:\n\nmov rax, 0x01           ; immediate - rax is now 1\nmov rax, rcx            ; register - rax is now a copy of rcx\nmov rax, [rbx]          ; memory - rbx is treated as pointer, it's data is copied into rax\nmov rax, qword [rbx + 8]; copying a quad word (8 bytes) into rax\n\n\nNotice the repeated usage of \"copy\"? Just because the instruction is \"mov\", doesn't mean we are moving anything.\n\nlea instruction\n\nLoad Effective Address Instruction \nCalculates an address, but does not attempt to access it\nThis is useful when wanting to use address calculation (ex: [rdx+4]) but not wanting to change the address\nFor example:\n\n; calculate the address by taking the address of what rdx points at, /\n; and adding 8 bytes to it (prehaps indexing into an array?)\n; NOTE: We are just calculating the addressses, not changing them!\n\nlea rax, [rdx + 8]\nmov rax, [rax]          ; this will access whatever was in rdx + 8\n\n; what's different from above vs\n\nmov rax [rdx, + 8]\n\n; or...\nadd rdx, 8\nmov rax, [rdx]\n\nxchg instruction\n\nExchange instruction\nExchanges the values provided atomically. \nIn other words, it SWAPS the values. \n\n\n\nxchg rax, rcx   ; exchange two register values\n; exchange a register value with a value stored in memory\nxchg rax, [rcx]\n\n; live example\nmov rax, 10\nmov rcx, 20\n\nxchg rax, rcx   ; what is the value or rax and rcx now?\nmov rcx, 0xdeadbeef     ; setting rcx to a address\nmov [rcx], 0\nxchg rax, [rcx] ; what is the value of rax and rcx now?\n\n"},"01_Introduction/01.3_Debugging_ASM_pt1.html":{"url":"01_Introduction/01.3_Debugging_ASM_pt1.html","title":"Debugging ASM Part 1","keywords":"","body":"Section 1.3: Debugging Assembly (pt 1) & Making the Files\n\nWhy Debug Assembly?\nUnlike many other programming languages, assembly allows for much more control over lower level software/hardware. We will be making changes that are much harder to track mentally. Debugging allows us to see the memory itself, registers, etc. Some debugging tools even allow us to modify said registers and memory values. \nWe will be using the GNU Project Debugger or GDB for short while in Linux. GDB is a command line debugger which provides a large set of features:\n\nNatively supports Python scripting\nSupports a large number of architectures (and even quite a few languages)\nProvides a Text User Interface (TUI) mode\n\nHow to Debug using Assembly\nPreconfiguration\nWhen launching GDB, you may notice your interface does not look like mine. This is because I use a configuration file that adds customization to my interface. Lucky for you, we provided you with a preconfiguration file. The gdbinit providese a way to run a number of setup commands at launch. You will just need to copy the config file to your home directory:\ncp ~/path/to/repo/handouts/sample![](/imgs/gdb1.png)![](/imgs/gdb1.png)-gdbinit ~/.gdbinit\nThe instructions above will copy the sample gdbinit to your home directory as a hidden file (as directed by the . in front of the name) and will rename it to gdbinit\nMake the Files\n\nAfter you have written your code, you will need to cd to the path and run a series of commands to make the files. \nChange Dirs to proper lab:\ncd ~/path/to/lab1/\nMake the files (DO NOT FORGET THE PERIODS!):\ncmake . && cmake --build .\nThere is a file in the lab directory called CMakeLists.txt. This file instructs/configures a program build tool called CMAKE to build the nasm and cpp file and output an executable. If you peek inside of the cpp file, you will notice a couple of things. First, we \"extern\" some functions. This allows us to create a link of sort between the nasm and cpp file. We then later call the extern'd function in main (or some other function) as if it were a regular function. If you don't understand how the C/C++ compiler and linker work, feel free to ask for a refresher and I will provide one given we have time.\n\nLaunching an Executable with GDB\n\nCD to directory containing lab\nrun: gdb labx (x being the lab number)\nIn the GDB window, type \"run\" to execute the program. The program will run all the way through because there are no break points. \nIn the GDB window, type \"quit\" to quit GDB. You will be returned to the standard terminal. \n```\n$ cd ~/path/to/lab1\n$ gdb lab1\n\n(gdb) run\n...\n(gdb) quit\n\n### Basic Usage\n* **info (command)** : displays information (in general, or about a specific command)\n* **help (command)** : can provide context-specific help; t.g., listing avaliable commands/options\n* **refresh** : will redraw the console window (very important)\n\n### Breakpoints (break)\nUsing breakpoints allows us to programmatically set breakpoints without modifying application source code. We can set breakpoints on memory addresses, symbols (such as funciton names), etc. \n* **break (location)** : will create a breakpoint at the location. \n* **info break** : shows us information about all currently set breakpoints\n* **clear** or **delete** : Allows us to remove breakpoints\n\n#### Example:\n(gdb) break myfunc\nBreakpoint 1 at 0x4004a4\nNum     Type       Disp     Enb     Addreses\n1       Breakpoint  keep    y       0x00000000004004a4\n(gdb) delete 1\n(deb info break)\nNo breakpoints or watchpoints\n\nSetting breakpoints programmatically as shown above, may sometimes be difficult. A good strategy may include applying breakpoints directly in your code for debugging purposes. Fortunately, an assembly instruction exists for doing just this!\n```nasm\nint3;   NOTE: no space between int and 3\nWhich translates to the opcode:\n0xcc\n\nBy placing the above in your code, the debugger will be interrupted on run and will automatically wait for the user to continue the program or start stepping before continuing.\nInstructions\n\nstep/s : Single stepping (can also use stepi)\nnext/n : Stepping Over (can also use nexti)\ncontinue : continue normal execution (you can also create another breakpoint and continue to it)\nfinish : Continue until the current function returns\n\nAdditonal Resources\n\nGDB Cheatsheet\n\nLab1\nProceed to the Lab1 directory and follow instructions\n"},"01_Introduction/01.4_DataTypesANDDebugging_pt2.html":{"url":"01_Introduction/01.4_DataTypesANDDebugging_pt2.html","title":"Data Types and Debugging Part 2","keywords":"","body":"Assembly Data Types and GDB Part 2\n\nWhen we think \"data types\", we need to understand that in Assembly, it's a different concept than in higher level languages. Typically in Assembly, data types are just bytes in a buffer. \"Data type\" is just an interpretation that's differentiated by size, alignment and certain bits being set. \nSome operations preserve special properties in a given data set (such as sign, e.g. (+/-))\nOther operations may expect different alignments in data, or may have issues with certain values (like floating points)\n\nX86(_64) General Data Sizes\n\nByte - smallest addressable unit (8 bit)\nWord - 2 bytes\nDword - double word (4 bytes - x86 pointer width)\nQword - quad word (8 bytes - x64 pointer width)\n\nGDB: Examining Memory\n\nWe can use GDB to examine varius places in memory \"x\" (for \"eXamine\")\nx has several options: \nx/nfu - where n is the Number of things to examine, f is the Format and u is the Unit size\nx addr - examines the memory address typed in by the user\nx $ - examines the memory address pointed to by the register\n\n\n\nGDB Formatting\n\nThe \"f\" in x/nfu stands for formatting as we stated above\nFormat options include:\ns - For a NULL-terminated string\ni - For a machine instruction\nx - for a hexadecimal (the default, which changes when x is used)\n\n\nFor example: Disassembling at RIP\n\n(gdb) x/i $rip\nGDB Unit Sizes\n\nThe \"u\" in x/nfu stands for Unit Size as we stated above\nUnit size options are a bit confusing in the context of x86/(_64) assembly and include: \nb - bytes\nh - halfwords (equivalent to \"word\" in x86(_64) asm; e.g., 2 bytes)\nw - words (4 bytes, equivalent to dwords)\ng - giant words (8 bytes, equivalent to qwords)\n\n\n\n\nSub Registers\n\nSubregisters are a part of the bigger \"parent\" register\nUnless special instructions (not yet mentioned) are used, will not modify data in the other portions of the register when used. \n\n\n\n\n\n64bit\n32bit\n16bit\n8bit high/low\n\n\n\n\n\nrax\neax\nax\nah/al\n\n\n\n\nrcx\necx\ncx\nch/cl\n\n\n\n\nrdx\nedx\ndx\ndh/dl\n\n\n\n\nrdi\nedi\nN/A\nN/A\n\n\n\n\nrsi\nesi\nN/A\nN/A\n\n\n\n\nMemory/Register Access - mov\n\nWhen accessing memory, the amount of data to copy can be specified:\n\nmov al, byte [rsi]      ; copy a single byte\nmov eax, dword [rcx]    ; copy a dword (4 bytes)\nmov rax, qword [rsi]    ; copy a qword (8 bytes)\n\nNotice the register/subregisters used? They match the size of data we are copying.\n\nAlso, data can be copied from subregister to subregister:\n\nmov al, cl      ; copy from cl to al\nxchg al, ah      ; exchange the low and high bytes in ax\n\nRegister Access - movzx\n\nmovzx stands for \"Move with zero extend\". When moving source data that is smaller than the destination size, zero out the remaining bits. \nBasic use:\n\nmovzx rax, cl                   ; everything above al is now set to 0\nmovzx rax, byte [rsi + 5]       ; what happens here?\n\nDID YOU KNOW? The first letter in \"al\" represents the middle letter in the 64 and 32 bit register... rax/eax. The second letter, 'l', stands for low (or 'h' high). This applies to all registers and subregisters. rCx = ch/cl. rDx = dh/dl. etc. 16bit registers always end in 'x' and start with their parents middle letter. rax/eax = ax. rcx/ecx = cx, etc. This should make it easier to remember the subregisters of the parent register!\nLab2\nProceed to the Lab2 directory and follow instructions\n"},"01_Introduction/01.5_Adv_Types.html":{"url":"01_Introduction/01.5_Adv_Types.html","title":"Advanced Types and Concepts","keywords":"","body":"Advanced Types and Concepts\nStructures\n\nNASM provides a data structure concept for convenience in hanlding complex data types\nMore of a macro than something representative of a C-style struct\nSo try not to compare this to a C-style struct too much\n\n\nVery useful for keeping track of local variables or parameters (among other things)\n\nstruc MyStruct\n    .field1         resd 1      ; field1's size is 1 dword\n    .field2         resd 1      ; field2's size is 1 dword\n    .field3         resq 1      ; field3's size is 1 qword\n    .next           resd 1      ; next's size is 1 dword... address to next node in linked-list (if this were a linked list)\nendstruc\n\n; ...\n; Let's assume rdi points to MyStruct\n; This will be equivalent to: mov rax, [rdi+8]\nmov rax, [rdi + MyStruct.field3]\n\n; Assuming this is a linked list\nmov rdi, [rdi + MyStruct.next]\n\n; After the instruction above is ran... we are now on the next node.\n\n\nArray Iteration\n\nIterating through an array requires knowing the size of the elements within it. \nTo iterate through an array, you simply dereference the address and add the amount of bytes to the next element. \n\n; assume rsi is storing the address to an array of characters\nmov rax, [rsi]      ; this gives us the first character\nmov rax, [rsi+1]    ; this gives us the second character\nmov rax, [rsi+5]    ; this gives us the sixth character\nmov rax, [rsi]      ; this still gives us the first character\n\n; there is also this method, not recommended if it can be avoided\ninc rsi             ; this will set rsi to the second character\nmov rax, [rsi]      ; this will give us the second character\n\n; The above works great, now let's assume it's a array of ints\n; ints are generally 4 bytes\n; We can use another method to allow for itteration\n\nmov rax, [rsi]          ; still grabs first int\nmov rcx, 2              ; let's grab third element, by setting a count\nmov rax, [rsi+rcx*4]         ; this is essientially rcx * 4 (so count x size) and adding it to the array's address\n\n; As well as with characters, there is this method\nadd rsi, 4          ; next iteration\nmov rax, [rsi]      ; next itterations value\nadd rsi, 4\nmov rax, [rsi]      ; third value\n; ...\n\n"},"02_Basic_Operations/":{"url":"02_Basic_Operations/","title":"Basic Operations","keywords":"","body":"Ch02 Basic Operations\nObjectives\n\nUtilize basic arithmetic and bit operations\nUnderstand the difference between signed and unsigned values, from an assembly perspective\nUnderstand the Two's Complement representation of signed numbers\nUnderstand the Stack as it pertains to assembly programming, and implement functions that utilize it to load and store data\n\n"},"02_Basic_Operations/02.1_Arithmetic_Instructions.html":{"url":"02_Basic_Operations/02.1_Arithmetic_Instructions.html","title":"Arithmetic Instructions","keywords":"","body":"Arithmetic Instructions\n\nThe add and sub Instructions\n\nDescription:\nAdds and subtracts arbitrary values.

You need to be entirely open minded when entering this section. Many concepts go against the flow of logic.\n\nWhat is the Stack?\nThe stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which operations are performed. Think of the stack as concept that keeps track of which operation to run next as well as previous operations (if needed) to allow for returns and such. \n\nThe Stack grows from high memory addresses to low memory addresses\nWhen looking at a stack graphic, the top of the photo is the bottom of the stack (higher addresses), in which the stack grows down into lower addresses. \nThe current function typically exists within a stack \"frame\" (but now always) \n\nStack Frames\nA stack frame is a related piece of data that gets pushed onto the greater stack. A stack frame often represents a function call and it's argument data. We will be getting into much more detail in chapter 3 about how the stack frame works. \nRegisters\n\nStack Pointer - RSP (or ESP) points to the top of the stack \nBase Pointer - RBP (or EBP) points to the \"base\" of the stack frame\nThe base pointer is a location we use as reference to grab arguments and locals. \n\n\n\nStack Frame Layout\n\n\n\n\nADDRESS\nVALUE/REG\n\n\n\n\n0x0018\nRBP\n\n\n0x0010\n0x0000\n\n\n0x0008\n0x0000\n\n\n0x0000\nRSP\n\n\n\nLet's break it down further...\n\n\nThe green represents function parameters\nThe blue represents local variables\nThe base pointer separates this for us, giving us a point in the stack frame to offset from in order to grab variables\nWhen working on a stack, the return address will always be EBP + 4\nOn 64-bit architecture, we can actually access data with RSP and free up RBP as a general register. Though much more reliable than it's implementation in other architectures... it's still very hard to use. So for our purposes, we will be learning how to access data with RBP.

Pop performs the opposite action, storing the value just below RSP in the register provided, and adding a pointer-width amount to RSP. For every push, you will need to pop!

So instead of starting at 0000... negative numbers start at 1111. The 1s and 0s are flipped. \nIf the left most bit is 0, then the number is positive. 1 is negative. \n\n\n\nTo get the negative version of a number... take the positive number, subtract by 1, then invert. \nThis may be hard to understand at first, but let's look at it via positive numbers first.
